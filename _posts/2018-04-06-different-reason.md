At the lab meeting, we are welcoming a replacement for our regular lab secretary that will soon deliver a baby.
The meeting is set for her normally non-working time, so prof raised a question whether this is convenient for her.
She said, that today is ok, because her husband is home and can feed the daughter that should come for lunch (the meeting is at the lunch time, the food is provided ;).
- But, my husband seems to have found a job, and he will not be home next week.
  At least, I hope he will not be home next week.
- <everybody: O_O> ...
- For a different reason :D.
