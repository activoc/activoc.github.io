Sunday evening, I went to take a printout of a paper I was going to review.
I need to say, that our building has a huge hole in the middle that runs from the glass roof all the way to the ground floor through all the other floors.
I was on the third floor.
On the ground floor there are a couple of tables and chairs, and students often study there.
On my way back, I looked down, and saw a girl (probably a student) at the table, which is normal, even for a sunday evening.
What is interesting is what she was doing.
She was cooking.
And not just some sandwiches, but she had all the cooking staff laying around, laptop (presumably with a recipy) in front of her and she was whisking something in a bowl!
This is the degree IC students integrate with the university to.
