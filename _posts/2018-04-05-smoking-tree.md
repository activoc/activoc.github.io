From the window in our kitchenette one can see a green hill with nice houses and some randomly scattered trees.
When we went for a lunch over there, I saw a suspicious thuja tree.
It is a nice, narrow and tall tree, but something was off.
There was smoke coming from all over its crone.
It came out sporadically and in great quantities.
At first I thought that the tree is on fire, but I could not see the flames.
Then the smoke stopped for some time before starting afresh.
That was very strange and the second guess I had was that someone hid a chimney pipe in the tree.
A friend said, that may be some kids were hiding there smoking :P

As the bursts of the smoke seemed to be corelated with gusts of wind, I think most likely that was some dust, brought short time before, but the true cause still remainds a mystery (the tree is still there, unburnt, but no more smoke is showing).
