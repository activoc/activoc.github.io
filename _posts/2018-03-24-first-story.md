Here it begins: the long path to enriching active vocabulary and improving my communication.

Today I watched an interesting (and first in my life) impro-match - a battle between improvisation comediens for the title of the most nimble mind.
At least that is what I imagined it to be.
It turned out just a friendly seance of fantasies and roleplay.
Today an ansemble of french, belgique and swiss teams incarnated as much drama as comedy, and came up with a breadthtaking plot right there on the spot, following cues from the spectators.
Starting by creating individual characters, after about two hours of play, they ended up intertwinning all the stories and getting together in the final lachrymatory act.
